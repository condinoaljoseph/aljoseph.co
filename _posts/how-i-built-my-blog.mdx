Internet is the most accessible source of knowledge. As a developer, I am a fan of reading technical blogs and documentation to stay updated and keep pace in the fast-changing world of technology. This leads me to create a blog site, my own space on the internet where I can share my ideas and contribute to the community.

There are a lot of options when deciding the tools to create your own blog. This article will show you an overview of how my blog works to give you an idea to start building your own blog.

## Design

This blog was inspired by Dan Abramov's overreacted.io. His site was forked from a blog starter written in Gatsby.js. What I love about his site is the minimalistic style. The design is simple and elegant. 

I wanted people to know that I am not a designer so I imitated his design and recreate it using different tools.

I know many of you are already familiar with my site's design like Guillermo does.

## The Stack

I like building this blog from scratch without using CMS like WordPress or no-code tools. This benefits me to learn and experiment with technologies that I am not familiar with. I totally customize my website and make my code base neat. 

When I'm choosing a stack, I have metrics to consider:

- Free or Low Cost.
- Developer Experience.
- Learning Experience.
