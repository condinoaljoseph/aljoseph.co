As a developer, I am a fan of reading technical blogs and documentation to stay updated and keep up with the technology trends these days. This leads me to write my own blogs and contribute to the community.

There are a lot of options when deciding the tools to create your own blog. This article will show you an overview of how my blog works to give you an idea to start building your own blog.

## Design

This blog was inspired by Dan Abramov's overreacted.io. His site was forked from a blog starter written in Gatsby.js. What I love about his site is the minimalistic style. The design is simple and elegant.

I wanted people to know that I am not a designer so I imitated his design and recreate it using different tools.
