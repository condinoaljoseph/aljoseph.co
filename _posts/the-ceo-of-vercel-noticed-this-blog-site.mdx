Our manager required us to publish a blog on our site to train our written communication. At least one blog each team per month. I like the idea so I created a personal blog site. I was inspired by Dan Abramov's [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io) which is written on [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). So I recreate it using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It is also to explore new skills and technologies like how to use the different types of pre-rendering in Next.js.

I was also amazed by how's Dan Abramov's blog site is performant when testing it on Lighthouse. Since our manager told us also to study web vitals I decided not just to imitate Dan's website design but also his site's performance.

I came to the point where I have a performance problem on my self-hosted fonts. I searched for tutorials and came up with Leerob's [site](https://leerob.io/) and [his youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0cOQ79WKZE) where he discussed this problem I faced. He is part of the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) team which is the author of Next.js. So I go to his [guestbook](https://leerob.io/guestbook) and message him to review my site.

## The Next Morning

... did not expect, Leerob's starred my repository and someone on the Vercel team also forked and contributed to my blog site. He is [pacocoursey](https://github.com/pacocoursey).

It was overwhelming and I'm so happy that day. I slept that night with a smile on my face.

## And there's more

I was shocked by the numbers of stars already on my blog repository. It suddenly had 30 stars in one day. I thought why and that's the moment when I search this keyword on google _aljoseph github_ I noticed a tweet where there is a screenshot of my blog site.

[**Guillermo Rauch**](https://vercel.com/about/rauchg) the CEO of Vercel, creator of the famous [socket.io](https://socket.io/) tagged me on his tweet.

It was so breathtaking. I am so proud of what I make even though the project is too basic.

He even tested my site on [web.dev](https://web.dev/measure/) and I am very thankful that our manager told us to learn about web vitals.

I am very motivated to learn new technologies. So I want also to encourage you to create your blog site. It will benefit you to learn new techniques and make yourself marketable. I hope it also helps you to feel motivated in your career as a web developer.
